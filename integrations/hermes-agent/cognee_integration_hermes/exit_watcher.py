"""Closing a Hermes session: improve, then unregister — always out of process.

Closing a session means two calls in a fixed order: ``improve(session_ids=[...])``
promotes the session's turns into the permanent graph, and only then may the agent
connection be unregistered. The order is load-bearing. The local server runs with
``COGNEE_AGENT_MODE=true``, so unregistering drops the agent count to zero and its
watchdog SIGTERMs the server within 60s — with no regard for pipelines still
running. Unregister first and the promotion is killed halfway.

Doing that in Hermes itself forces a choice between two things the user should not
have to trade: a fast exit, or a session that actually reaches the graph. Out of
process there is no trade — the worker blocks on the improve and its blocking
costs nobody anything. So both paths out of a session route here:

* **clean** — ``finalize()`` hands the close to a detached worker (``--final``)
  the moment ``on_session_end`` fires, and Hermes exits without waiting.
* **unclean** — ``arm()`` leaves a watcher polling the Hermes PID from session
  start; if Hermes dies without ever handing off, the watcher closes the session
  itself.

Both converge on :func:`fire`, which claims a once-marker beside the state file
so that a session is closed exactly once no matter how many workers reach it. The
poller is deliberately *not* stood down when a finalizer is spawned: if that
spawn dies before claiming, the poller is still there to catch it.

This module runs as a plain script (``python exit_watcher.py --state <path>
[--final]``), outside the package, so nothing here may import from the package —
everything it needs travels in the state file, plus the API key, which stays out
of world-readable places: it is handed over via the child's environment and falls
back to the shared ``~/.cognee-plugin/api_key.json`` cache.
