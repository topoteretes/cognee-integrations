"""Isolates the unit suite from the developer's own cognee setup.

Almost every env patch in this suite is ``clear=False`` — deliberately, because
each test declares only the handful of variables it cares about. That leaves the
rest of ``os.environ`` showing through, and the plugin reads two dozen
``COGNEE_*`` variables to decide its transport, its key, and its roots. On a CI
runner nothing is set and the suite is green; on the machine of anyone who
actually *runs* cognee it is not. A single exported variable is enough:

    COGNEE_API_KEY=...   -> 7 failures (TestApiKeyResolution: a configured key
                            skips the minting path those tests exercise)
    COGNEE_EMBEDDED=true -> 3 failures (TestTransportSelection: embedded mode
    COGNEE_TRANSPORT=sdk -> 3 failures  outranks the HTTP default under test)

So the baseline is scrubbed here instead of at two dozen call sites. Tests that
want a variable still set it themselves; what they no longer inherit is the
developer's shell. See SDK-454.
